### Description

Integrate GO1 in the environment and add some tools for action filtering and smoothing.

<hr  hr\>

### Motivation and Context

- In the lab we have GO1.
- Action smoothing with the hope to experience a more realistic behavior from pybullet simulator.

It's known that complex dynamics ,not captured by simulators, mostly arise in the high frequency regime. The idea is to exploit the simulator in a frequency range which is able to perform realistic simulations inside. (some note on simulations here: [SpaceBok](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09357.pdf))

### Types of changes

- [ ] added action interpolation during action repeat
- [ ] added a lowpass action filter
- [ ] added action clipping
- [ ] added possibility to select go1 or a1
- [ ] changed folder tree
- [ ] robot settling (after reset) is the same regardless of spring presence
- [ ] robot settling takes into account the motor control mode
- [ ] same initial default robot position regardless of spring presence
- [ ] deleted turn_off motors method
- [ ] added a method to add sparse reward
