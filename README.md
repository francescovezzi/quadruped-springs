## Installation

Recommend using conda with python3.7 or higher. After installing conda, this can be done as follows:

`conda create -n [YOUR-ENV] python=3.7`

To activate the conda env: 

`conda activate [YOUR-ENV]` 

Your command prompt should now look like: 

`[YOUR-ENV] user@pc:path$`

Install all dependencies:

`pip install -e . `

## Code structure
- [env](./env) for the quadruped environment files, please see the gym simulation environment [quadruped_gym_env.py](./env/quadruped_gym_env.py), the robot specific functionalities in [quadruped.py](./env/quadruped.py). In [control_interface](./env/control_interface) is contained the API for converting action to torques. In [sensors](./env/sensors) quadruped sensors and sensors collections are described. The tasks are defined in [tasks](./env/tasks).
[springs.py](./env/springs.py) contains parallel elastic springs description. User can choose whether to enable them or not.
- [go1_description](./go1_description) contains the robot mesh files, urdf and global configuration variables as joint limits, sensor noise... etc.
- [utils](./utils) for auxiliary files and utilities e.g. plotting and video recording.
- [hopf_network.py](./hopf_polar.py) provides a CPG class skeleton for various gaits, and maps these to be executed on an instance of the  [quadruped_gym_env](./env/quadruped_gym_env.py) class. Please fill in this file carefully. 

## Code resources
- The [PyBullet Quickstart Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.2ye70wns7io3) is the current up-to-date documentation for interfacing with the simulation. 
- The quadruped environment took inspiration from [Google's motion-imitation repository](https://github.com/google-research/motion_imitation) based on [this paper](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/Robotic_Imitation/2020_Robotic_Imitation.pdf). 
- Reinforcement learning algorithms from [stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). Also see for example [ray[rllib]](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and [spinningup](https://github.com/openai/spinningup).
